1.  Introduction

   In constrained networks [RFC7228], the link layer may restrict the
   payload sizes of frames to only a few hundreds bytes.  Encrypted DNS
   resolution, such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484] or DNS over CoAP
   (DoC) [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap], may lead to DNS message sizes
   that exceed this limit, even when implementing header compression
   such as 6LoWPAN IPHC [RFC6282] or SCHC [RFC8724], [RFC8824].

   Although adoption layers such as 6LoWPAN [RFC4944] or SCHC [RFC8724]
   offer fragmentation to comply with small MTUs, fragmentation should
   be avoided in constrained networks.  Fragmentation combined with high
   packet loss multiplies the likelihood of loss.  Hence, a compression
   format that reduces fragmentation of DNS messages is beneficial.

   This document specifies a compact data format for DNS messages using
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC8949] encoding.
   Additionally, unnecessary or redundant information are stripped off
   DNS messages.  To use the outcome of this specification in DoH and
   DoC, this document also specifies a Media Type header for DoH and a
   Content-Format option for DoC.

   Note, that there is another format that expresses DNS messages in
   CBOR, C-DNS [RFC8618].  C-DNS is primarily a file format to minimize
   traces of multiple DNS messages and uses the fact that there are
   multiple messages to do its compression.  Common values such as names
   or addresses are collected in separate tables which are referenced
   from the messages, comparable to Packed CBOR [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed].
   However, this may add overhead for individual DNS messages.

   The format described in this document is a transfer format that aims
   to provide conciseness and compression for individual DNS messages to
   be sent over the network.  This is achieved applying the following
   objectives:

   Conciseness:

   *  Encoding DNS messages in CBOR and

   *  Omitting (redundant) fields in DNS queries and responses.

   Compression:

   *  Providing easy to implement name compression that allows for on-
      the-fly construction of DNS queries and responses and

   *  Providing optional address and value compression in DNS responses
      using Packed CBOR [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed].

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   CBOR types (unsigned integer, byte string, text string, arrays, etc.)
   are used as defined in [RFC8949].

   The terms "DNS server", "DNS client", and "(DNS) resolver" are used
   as defined in [RFC8499].

   A DNS query is a message that queries DNS information from an
   upstream DNS resolver.  The reply to that is a DNS response.

   The DNS message format specified in [RFC1035] for DNS over UDP we
   call "classic DNS format" throughout this document or refer to it by
   its media type "application/dns-message" as specified in [RFC8484].

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   The term "constrained networks" is used as defined in [RFC7228].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   To define the representation of binary objects we use the Concise
   Data Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610].  For examples, we use the
   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] with
   the e'' application extension [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref].

3.  CBOR Representations (application/dns+cbor)

   DNS messages in "application/dns+cbor" are represented as CBOR arrays
   to minimize overhead.  All CBOR items used in this specification are
   of definite length.  CBOR arrays that do not follow the length
   definitions of this or of follow-up specifications, MUST be silently
   ignored.  CBOR arrays that exceed the message size provided by the
   transport, MUST be silently ignored.  It is assumed that DNS query
   and DNS response are distinguished message types and that the query
   can be mapped to the response by the transfer protocol of choice.

   dns-message = dns-query / dns-response

     Figure 1: This document defines both DNS Queries and Responses in
                                    CDDL

   If, for any reason, a DNS message cannot be represented in the CBOR
   format specified in this document, or if unreasonable overhead is
   introduced, a fallback to another DNS message format, e.g., the
   classic DNS format specified in [RFC1035], MUST always be possible.

3.1.  Domain Name Representation

   Domain names are represented by a sequence of one or more (unicode)
   text strings.  For instance, "example.org" would be represented as
   "example","org" in CBOR diagnostic notation.  The root domain "." is
   represented as an empty string "".  The absence of any label means
   the name is elided.  For the purpose of this document, domain names
   remain case-insensitive as specified in [RFC1035].

   The representation of a domain name is defined in Figure 2.  A label
   may either be encoded in ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE) [RFC5891]
   embedded within UTF-8 encoding of the text strings or plain UTF-8.
   It is RECOMMENDED to use the encoding with the shorter length in
   bytes, otherwise message sizes may increase.  A decoder identifies



Lenders, et al.           Expires 8 August 2026                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   the ACE encoding by identifying the label as a valid A-label (see
   [RFC5891]) and MUST assume the label to be encoded in UTF-8
   otherwise.

   This sequence of text strings is supposed to be embedded into a
   surrounding array, usually the query or resource record.

   Name compression is implemented using an extension to Packed CBOR,
   see Section 4.1.  For readers unfamiliar with Packed CBOR this name
   compression can be abstracted to a name compression similar to that
   described in Section 4.1.4 of [RFC1035].  However, instead of using
   the byte index as reference within the message, text strings are
   counted, starting at 0, depth-first within the message.  That number
   is used as index for the reference.  Since names are the only text
   strings in a CBOR-based DNS message, the end of a name can be
   identified when the decoder cursor does not point to a text string or
   reference to another text string anymore.  For the reference itself,
   either simple values or tag 6 are used (see Section 2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed]).

   domain-name = ( *label )
   label = tstr

                      Figure 2: Domain Name Definition

3.2.  DNS Resource Records

   This document specifies the representation of both standard DNS
   resource records (RRs, see [RFC1035]) and EDNS option pseudo-RRs (see
   [RFC6891].  If for any reason, a resource record cannot be
   represented in the given formats, they can be represented in their
   binary wire-format form as a byte string.

   Further special records, e.g., TSIG [RFC8945], can be defined in
   follow-up specifications using the $$structured-ts-rd extension point
   (see Figure 4) and are out of scope of this document.

   The representation of a DNS resource records is defined in Figure 3.

   $$dns-rr = rr / #6.141(opt-rr) / bstr

                  Figure 3: DNS Resource Record Definition

3.2.1.  Standard RRs

   Standard DNS resource records are encoded as CBOR arrays containing 2
   or more entries in the following order:

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   1.  An optional name (as text string, see Section 3.1),

   2.  A TTL (as unsigned integer),

   3.  An optional record type (as unsigned integer),

   4.  An optional record class (as unsigned integer), and lastly

   5.  A record data entry (as byte string, domain name, or array for
       dedicated record data representation) or a boolean (true) that
       indicates that the resource record is actually a resource record
       set with an array of one or more record data entries following.
       In the latter case, individual domain names need to be put into
       their own array.

   If the first item of the resource record is a text string, it is the
   first label of a domain name (see Section 3.1).  If the name is
   elided, the name is derived from the question section of the message.
   For responses, the question section is either taken from the query
   (see Section 3.3) or provided with the response see Section 3.4.  The
   query may be derived from the context of the transfer protocol.

   If the record type is elided, the record type from the question is
   assumed.  If record class is elided, the record class from the
   question is assumed.  When a record class is required to be
   expressed, the record type MUST also be provided.

   The byte string format of the record data as a byte string follows
   the classic DNS format as specified in Section 3.3 of [RFC1035] (or
   other specifications of the respective record type).  Note that the
   CBOR format does not include the RDLENGTH field from the classic
   format as this value is encoded in the length field of the CBOR
   header of the byte string.

   If the record data represents a domain name (e.g., for CNAME or PTR
   records), the record data MAY be represented as domain name as
   specified in Section 3.1.  This way of representing the record data
   means that name compression (see Section 4.1) can also be used on it.

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   Depending on the record type, the record data may also be expressed
   as an array.  Some initial array types are specified below.  Future
   specifications can extend the definition for $$structured-ts-rd in
   Figure 4.  Extensions to that in this document mainly serve to expose
   names to name compression (see Section 4.1).  There is an argument to
   be made for CBOR-structured formats of other record data
   representations (e.g. DNSKEY or RRSIG), but structuring such records
   as an array usually adds more overhead than just transferring the
   byte representation.  As such, structured record data that do not
   contain names are to be represented as a byte string in this
   specification.

   Multiple resource records of the same type, class, and TTL can be
   summarized to a resource record set.  A decoder can be notified about
   this, by including the boolean true value before an array of multiple
   record data entries of the same type.  Note, that this adds more
   overhead to the message and should only really be considered, when
   there are more than one resource records of the same type, class, and
   TTL in the message.

3.2.1.1.  SOA Record Data

   The record data of RRs with record-type = 6 (SOA) MAY be expressed as
   an array with at least 7 entries representing the 7 parts of the SOA
   resource record defined in [RFC1035] in the following order:

   *  MNAME as a domain name (see Section 3.1),

   *  SERIAL as an unsigned integer,

   *  REFRESH as an unsigned integer,

   *  RETRY as an unsigned integer,

   *  EXPIRE as an unsigned integer,

   *  MINIMUM as an unsigned integer, and

   *  RNAME as a domain name (see Section 3.1).

   MNAME and RNAME are put to the beginning and end of the array,
   respectively, to keep their labels apart.

3.2.1.3.  SRV Record Data

   The record data of RRs with record-type = 33 (SRV) MAY be expressed
   as an array with at least 3 entries representing the parts of the SRV
   resource record defined in [RFC2782] in the following order:

   *  Priority as an unsigned integer,

   *  an optional Weight as an unsigned integer,

   *  Port as an unsigned integer,

   *  Target as a domain name (see Section 3.1).

   If the weight is present or not can be determined by the number of
   unsigned integers before Target. 2 unsigned integers before the
   Target mean the weight was elided and defaults to 0. 3 unsigned
   integers before the Target mean the weight is in the second position
   of the record data array.  The default of 0 was picked, as this is
   the value domain administrators should pick when there is no server
   selection to do [RFC2782].

   The definition for SRV record data can be seen in Figure 7.

3.2.1.4.  SVCB and HTTPS Record Data

   The record data of RRs with record-type = 64 (SVCB) and record-type =
   65 (HTTPS) MAY be expressed as an array with at least 3 entries
   representing the 3 parts of the SVCB/HTTPS resource record defined in
   [RFC9460] in the following order:

   *  An optional SvcPriority as an unsigned integer,

   *  An optional TargetName as a domain name (see Section 3.1), and

   *  SvcParams as an array of alternating pairs of SvcParamKey (as
      unsigned integer) and SvcParamValue (as byte string).  The type of
      SvcParamValue may be extended in future specifications.

   If the SvcPriority is present can be determined by checking if the
   record data array starts with an unsigned integer or not.  If the
   array does not start with an unsigned integer, the SvcPriority is
   elided and defaults to 0, i.e., the record is in AliasMode (see
   Section 2.4.2 of [RFC9460]).  If the array starts with a unsigned
   integer, it is the SvcPriority.

   If the TargetName is present can be determined by checking if the
   record data array has a domain name after the SvcPriority, i.e., if
   the SvcPriority is elided the array would start with a domain name.
   If there is no domain name after the SvcPriority, the TargetName is
   elided and defaults to the sequence of text strings "" (i.e. the root
   domain "." in the common name representation defined in Section 2.3.1
   of [RFC1035], see Section 3.1) and Section 2.5 of [RFC9460].  If
   there is a domain name after the SvcPriority, the TargetName is not
   elided and in the domain name form specified in Section 3.1.

          Figure 8: SVCB and HTTPS Resource Record Data Definition

   The SvcParams are provided as an array rather than a map, as their
   order needs to be preserved [RFC9460] which can not be guaranteed for
   maps.

3.2.2.  EDNS OPT Pseudo-RRs

   EDNS OPT Pseudo-RRs are represented as a CBOR array.  To distinguish
   them from normal standard RRs, they are marked with tag TBD141.

   Name and record type can be elided as they are always "." and OPT
   (41), respectively [RFC6891].

   The UDP payload size may be the first element as an unsigned integer
   in the array.  It MUST be elided if its value is the default value of
   512, the maximum allowable size for unextended DNS over UDP (see
   Sections 2.3.4 and 4.2.1 of [RFC1035]).

   The next element is an array of the options as alternating pairs of
   option code (as unsigned integer) and option data (as byte string).
   The type of the option data may be extended in future specifications.
   As per Section 6.1.2 of [RFC6891], the order of options is not
   defined in this specification, but the considerations to order
   provided in Section 6.1.2 of [RFC6891] also apply here.

   After that, up to three unsigned integers are following.  The first
   being the extended flags as unsigned integer (implied to be 0 if
   elided), the second the extended RCODE as an unsigned integer
   (implied to be 0 if elided), and the third the EDNS version (implied
   to be 0 if elided).  They are dependent on each of their previous
   elements.  If the EDNS version is not elided, both extended flags and
   extended RCODE MUST not be elided.  If the RCODE is not elided the
   extended flags MUST not be elided.

   Note that future EDNS versions may require a different format than
   the one described above.

3.3.  DNS Queries

   DNS queries are encoded as CBOR arrays containing up to 6 entries in
   the following order:

   1.  An optional boolean field,

   2.  An optional flag field (as unsigned integer),

   3.  The question section (as array),

   4.  An optional answer section (as array),

   5.  An optional authority section (as array), and

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   6.  An optional additional section (as array)

   If the first item is a boolean and when true, it tells the responding
   resolver that it MUST include the question section in its response.
   If that boolean is not present, it is assumed to be false.

   If the first item of the query is an array, it is the question
   section, if it is an unsigned integer, it is as flag field and maps
   to the header flags in [RFC1035] and the "DNS Header Flags" IANA
   registry including the QR flag and the Opcode.

   If the flags are elided, the value 0 is assumed.

   This specification assumes that the DNS messages are sent over a
   transfer protocol that can map the queries to their responses, e.g.,
   DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484] or DNS over CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap].  As a consequence, the DNS transaction
   ID is always elided and the value 0 is assumed.

   A question record within the question section is encoded as a CBOR
   array containing the following entries:

   1.  The queried name (as domain name, see Section 3.1) which MUST not
       be elided,

   2.  An optional record type (as unsigned integer), and

   3.  An optional record class (as unsigned integer)

   If the record type is elided, record type AAAA as specified in
   [RFC3596] is assumed.  If the record class is elided, record class IN
   as specified in [RFC1035] is assumed.  When a record class is
   required, the record type MUST also be provided.

   There usually is only one question record [RFC9619], which is why the
   question section is a flat array and not nested like the other
   sections.  This serves to safe overhead from the additional CBOR
   array header.  In the rare cases when there is more than one question
   record in the question section, the next question just follows.  In
   this case, for every question but the last, the record type MUST be
   included, i.e., it is not optional.  This way it is ensured that the
   parser can distinguish each question by looking up the name first.

   The remainder of the query is either empty or MUST consist of up to
   three extra arrays.

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   If one extra array is in the query, it encodes the additional section
   of the query as an array of DNS resource records (see Section 3.2).
   If two extra arrays are in the query, they encode, in that order, the
   authority and additional sections of the query each as an array of
   DNS resource records (see Section 3.2).  If three extra arrays are in
   the query, they encode, in that order, the answer section, the
   authority, and additional sections of the query each as an array of
   DNS resource records (see Section 3.2).

   As such, the highest precedence in elision is given to the answer
   section, as it only occurs with mDNS to signify Known Answers
   [RFC6762].  The lowest precedence is given to the additional section,
   as it may contain EDNS OPT Pseudo-RRs, which are common in queries
   (see Section 3.2.2).

   The representation of a DNS query is defined in Figure 10.

3.4.  DNS Responses

   A DNS response is encoded as a CBOR array containing up to 5 entries.

   1.  An optional flag field (as unsigned integer),

   2.  An optional question section (as array, encoded as described in
       Section 3.3)

   3.  The answer section (as array),

   4.  An optional authority section (as array), and

   5.  An optional additional section (as array)

   As for queries, the DNS transaction ID is elided and implied to be 0.

   If the CBOR array is a response to a query for which the flags
   indicate that flags are set in the response, they MUST be set
   accordingly and thus included in the response.  If the flags are not
   included, the flags are implied to be 0x8000 (everything unset except
   for the QR flag).

   If the response includes only one array, then the DNS answer section
   represents an array of one or more DNS Resource Records (see
   Section 3.2).

   If the response includes more than 2 arrays, the first entry may be
   the question section, identified by not being an array of arrays.  It
   MUST be included, if the client requested it using the boolean field
   in the query.  If it is present, it is followed by the answer
   section.  The question section is encoded as specified in
   Section 3.3.

   If the answer section is followed by one extra array, this array is
   the additional section.  Like the answer section, the additional
   section is represented as an array of one or more DNS Resource
   Records (see Section 3.2).

   If the answer section is followed by two extra arrays, the first is
   the authority section, and the second is the additional section.  The
   authority section is also represented as an array of one or more DNS
   Resource Records (see Section 3.2).

   The authority section is given precedence in elision over the
   additional section, as due to EDNS options or, e.g., CNAME answers
   that also provide the A/AAAA records.  The additional section tends
   to show up more often than the authority section.

4.  Compression with Packed CBOR

   Packed CBOR [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed] is used for name compression in
   "application/dns+cbor".

   If both DNS server and client support table setup tag 113 as
   described in Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed], it MAY be used
   for further compression in DNS responses.  Especially IPv6 addresses,
   e.g., in AAAA resource records can benefit from straight referencing
   to compress common address prefixes.

4.1.  Name Compression

   Text-String-Suffix-Sequence-Packed-CBOR = #6.28259(rump)

      Figure 12: CDDL for name compression based on Packed CBOR and as
                         defined in this document.

   For name compression, a new packing table setup tag TBD28259 ('n' and
   'c' in ASCII) for Packed CBOR [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed] is defined.  Any
   "application/dns+cbor" encoder and decoder MUST support tag TBD28259
   for DNS queries and responses.  It provides an implicit text string
   suffix sequence table for shared items _V_. This table _V_ is
   appended to the existing table for shared items of any table setup
   tag enclosing tag TBD28259 (by default empty table).  This implicit
   (i.e. not explicitly represented) table _V_ is constructed as
   follows: Any coherent sequence of text strings encountered within the
   rump of tag TBD28259 when reading it depth-first, as well as any of
   its non-empty suffixes, ordered by their appearance within the rump,
   are added to the table as arrays marked with the splice integration
   tag 1115 (see [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed], Section 5.1).  If a sequence
   for which a tagged array is already in _V_ is encountered, a shared
   item reference _i_ is added to the rump instead, splicing the content
   of the array within tag 1115 into the existing array (see
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed], Section 5.1) and that sequence as well as its
   non-empty suffixes are not added again to _V_. The resulting rump
   should look like referencing the first instance of the _i_-th
   complete string sequence (depth first) in the sequence.

Internet-Draft                  dns+cbor                   February 2026


   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use any other table building tag as defined
   in Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed] within TBD28259, as the
   implicit table of TBD28259 may otherwise lead to more complicating
   en- and decoding steps.  Particularly, a one-pass decoding with
   minimal state of DNS messages SHOULD be ensured to be viable on
   constrained devices.  If another table setup needs to be transported
   within TBD28259, e.g., certain RDATA or option values might elect to
   use Packed CBOR as well, they SHOULD be encapsulated as encoded CBOR
   within a byte string using tag 24 [RFC8949].

   Due to the order of strings being important, special care should be
   taken for the order of map (major type 5, [RFC8949]) elements within
   tag TBD28259.  The "application/dns+cbor" media type specified within
   this document avoids maps for this reason, in addition to enforcing
   orders derived from DNS specifications, e.g., [RFC9460] for
   SvcParams.  If any other CBOR object than an object defined by dns-
   message in Figure 1 is compressed using TBD28259, map elements MUST
   be encoded in bytewise lexicographic order of their keys, as
   specified in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949], unless the definition of
   that particular object type provides a different predetermined order.

   The "application/dns+cbor" media type comes with an optional
   parameter "packed".  If it is not provided, the value of it is
   assumed to be 0.  With the "application/dns+cbor;packed=0" media type
   (i.e. even with "application/dns+cbor"), the tag TBD28259 is
   implicit, i.e., it SHOULD NOT be sent.  This avoids sending the 3
   bytes of overhead generated by the presence of the tag.  If the
   decoder encounters an object marked with "application/
   dns+cbor;packed=0" that is tagged TBD28259, it MUST NOT discard it
   and parse its content as if it were implicit.  Otherwise, it might
   incur an additional message to be sent and media type negotiation
   might fail unnecessarily.

   The splice integration tag 1115 is the only integration tag in use
   for "application/dns+cbor" for "packed=0" and "packed=1" (see
   Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed]).

   Name compression with an example message can be found in Section 8.3.

4.2.  Further DNS Representation with Tag 113

   The representation of DNS responses with packed value 1, i.e.
   "application/dns+cbor;packed=1", has the same semantics as for tag
   TBD113 (see Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed]) compressing the
   name-compressed response as rump.  The difference to
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-packed] is that tag TBD113 is implicit with media type
   parameter "packed=1", see Figure 13.

   Take the following definition:

   packed-dns-message = [
     [*shared-and-argument-item],
     rump
   ]

        Figure 13: Definition of packed DNS message with media type
                     "application/ dns+cbor;packed=1".

   When marked by the "application/dns+cbor;packed=1" media type and
   parameter it MUST be implicitly understood as the definition provided
   in Figure 14.

   Packed-Text-String-Suffix-Sequence-Packed-CBOR = #6.113(
     [
       [*shared-and-argument-item],
       Text-String-Suffix-Sequence-Packed-CBOR
     ]
   )

      Figure 14: The implicit definition of a packed DNS message with
                media type "application/dns+cbor;packed=1".

   If the decoder encounters an object marked with "application/
   dns+cbor;packed=1" that is tagged TBD113 or with its rump tagged
   TBD28259, it MUST NOT discard it and parse its content as if it were
   implicit.  Any object marked with "application/dns+cbor;packed=1"
   that does not fit the definition of packed-dns-message provided in
   Figure 13 or variants of explicit tags TBD113 or TBD28259 MUST be
   interpreted as an invalid message.

   "packed=1" compression of queries is not specified, as apart from
   EDNS(0) (see Section 3.2.2), they only consist of one question most
   of the time, i.e., there is close to no redundancy that is not
   already covered by "packed=0" and encoding such an object can be too
   complex for a potentially constrained resolver.

   An example of this mechanism, as well as pseudo-code for a simple
   decoder can be found in Section 8.5.

4.3.  Media Type Negotiation

   A DNS client tells a server that it would accept the media type
   "application/dns+cbor;packed=1" to negotiate (see, e.g., [RFC9110] or
   [RFC7252], Section 5.5.4) with the DNS server whether the server
   supports setup table tag TBD113.  If it does, it MAY request the
   response to be in packed value 1 (media type "application/
   dns+cbor;packed=1").  The server then SHOULD reply with the response
   in Packed CBOR, which it also signals with media type "application/
   dns+cbor;packed=1".  Otherwise, both fall back to the implicit
   "packed=0".

   how the compression is applied, is out of scope of this document.

5.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.1.  CDDL model for e'' application extension

   Figure 15 shows the CDDL model used for the e'' application extension
   (see [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref]) in our examples.  C- contants define
   DNS classes as unsigned integers from the "DNS CLASSes" sub-registry
   of the IANA "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" registry.  RR-
   constants define resource record types from the "Resource Record (RR)
   TYPEs" sub-registry of the IANA "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters"
   registry.

8.2.  DNS Queries

   A DNS query of the record AAAA in class IN for name "example.org" is
   represented in CBOR extended diagnostic notation (EDN)
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] with e'' application extension
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref] as follows:

   [["example", "org"]]

   The binary (in hexadecimal encoding) of the query looks as follows
   (14 bytes):

   81                      # array(1)
      82                   # array(2)
         67                # text(7)
            6578616d706c65 # "example"
         63                # text(3)
            6f7267         # "org"

   A query of an A record for the same name is represented as

   [["example", "org", e'RR-A']]

   or in binary (15 bytes)

   81                      # array(1)
      83                   # array(3)
         67                # text(7)

         01                # e'RR-A' (unsigned(1))

   A query of ANY record for that name is represented as

   [["example", "org", e'RR-ANY', e'C-ANY']]

         18 ff             # e'RR-ANY' (unsigned(255))

8.3.  Name Compression

   Take the following response _o_ in CBOR extended diagnostic notation
   (EDN) [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals].  It contains a question for the
   "www.example.org" AAAA record, with a "svc.www.example.org" CNAME
   answer and its AAAA record, as well as the "org.example.org" NS
   record for the "example.org" domain in the authority section, each
   record with TTL 3600:

   [
     ["www", "example", "org"],
     [
       [3600, "www", "example", "org", e'RR-CNAME', "svc", "www", "example", "org"],
       [3600, "svc", "www", "example", "org", ip'2001:db8::1']
     ],
     [
       [3600, "example", "org", e'RR-NS', "org", "example", "org"]
     ],
     []
   ]

         Figure 16: Unpacked example for implicit name compression.

   The object _o_ would be sent over the wire as the following 136 bytes
   of binary data, represented here with hexadecimal encoding (type and
   data noted in comment).

   Note that the sequence "org", simple(0) is added at index 4 with
   leading "org", instead of referencing index 2 + index 1 (simple(2),
   simple(1)), as it is its own distinct suffix sequence.  However, its
   suffix "example", "org" is not added to the table again, as it is
   already present at index 1.

8.4.  DNS Responses

   The responses to the examples provided in Section 8.2 are shown
   below.  We use the CBOR extended diagnostic notation (EDN) (see
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals] and Appendix G of [RFC8610]) with e''
   application extension [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref], most notably the
   "ip" extension to represent binary IP addresses as a IP address app-
   string literal.

   To represent an AAAA record with TTL 300 seconds for the IPv6 address
   2001:db8::1, a minimal response to [["example", "org"]] could be

   [[[300, ip'2001:db8::1']]]

   or in binary (23 bytes)

   81                                            # array(1)
      81                                         # array(1)
         82                                      # array(2)
            19 012c                              # unsigned(300)
            50                                   # bytes(16)
               20010db8000000000000000000000001  # ip'2001:db8::1'

   In this case, the name is derived from the query.

   If the name or the context is required, the following response would
   also be valid:

   [[["example", "org", 300, ip'2001:db8::1']]]

   In binary that response looks like the following (35 bytes):

   81                                            # array(1)
      81                                         # array(1)
         84                                      # array(4)
            67                                   # text(7)
               6578616d706c65                    # "example"
            63                                   # text(3)
               6f7267                            # "org"
            19 012c                              # unsigned(300)
            50                                   # bytes(16)
               20010db8000000000000000000000001  # ip'2001:db8::1'

   If the query can not be mapped to the response for some reason, a
   response would look like:

   [["example", "org"], [[300, ip'2001:db8::1']]]

   In binary that response looks like the following (36 bytes):

   82                                            # array(2)
      82                                         # array(2)

            19 012c                              # unsigned(300)
            50                                   # bytes(16)

   To represent a minimal response of an A record with TTL 3600 seconds
   for the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1, a minimal response to [["example",
   "org", 1]] could be

   [[[300, ip'192.0.2.1']]]

   or in binary (11 bytes)

   81                   # array(1)

      Figure 22: The packed representation of the example of a message
                marked with "application/dns+cbor;packed=1".

   Note, that the encoder needs to rewrite the references from Figure 16
   as the implicit table _V_ is appended to the shared argument table
   ["org", 600].

   In binary, that example looks like the following (represented in
   hexadecimal):

9.  Comparison to Classic DNS Wire Format

   Table 2 shows a comparison between the classic DNS wire format and
   the application/dns+cbor format.  Note that the worst case results
   typically appear only rarely in DNS.  The classic DNS format is
   preferred in those cases.  A key for which configuration was used in
   which case can be seen in Table 3.  Any name label that is longer
   than 23 bytes adds a name overhead of 1 byte to its CBOR type header.

10.  Change Log

10.1.  Since draft-lenders-dns-cbor-15
       (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-lenders-dns-cbor-15)

   *  Add Vadim Goncharov as contributor

   *  Add Mikolai Gütschow as co-author

   *  Make options in OPT record a flat list of alternating key-value-
      pairs

   *  Use e'' application extension in examples for better readability
      of RR types and clases

   *  Pass on name compression

      -  TBD28259 now appends, rather than prepends to existing packing
         tables to allow for single pass decoders with minimum state.

      -  Consequently, disallow inner table setup tags to TBD28259, as
         that would increase complexity of both decoders and encoders

      -  Add considerations on maps within TBD28259 (see also #15)

      -  Clarify implicit nature with packed

      -  Provide actual DNS examples

      -  Add example decoder as pseudo-code

10.2.  Since draft-lenders-dns-cbor-14
       (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-lenders-dns-cbor-14)

   *  Correction and nits

   *  Explicitly state which integration tags are in use

   *  Add binary examples in CBOR-pretty

   *  Unify formatting for and mention explicitly application/dns+cbor
      from the top

   *  Explicitly define behavior for query[0] = True in response text

   *  Clarifications around media type parameter packed=1

   *  Remove TBD reference (it never came to be)
